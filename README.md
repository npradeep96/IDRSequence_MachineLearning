# Predicting transcriptional function from IDR sequences of proteins
Code to featurize IDR sequences of transcription factors, transcriptional coactivators, and other nuclear proteins using statistical features and analyze if there is predictive power in the IDRs for function. 

The results of the analysis are summarized here: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/h8r6ur01pyw6wxxwcrvfm/Fall_22_ML_Project.pdf?rlkey=l6rb56zbymny66ts2rl04p2sv&dl=0
